# Database Fixes for User Profile Creation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive fixes implemented to address database-related issues during user authentication and profile creation.

## Problem

Users were experiencing authentication errors with the message:
> "The database could not save your user profile. This is a server configuration issue. Please contact support."

The root causes were:

1. Email uniqueness constraints in the profiles table
2. Missing Row Level Security (RLS) policies for the service role
3. Ineffective error handling during profile creation
4. Lack of resilience to handle duplicate emails

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Improved Profile Creation in Middleware

- Enhanced the `createProfileWithServiceRoleInMiddleware` function to:
  - Check for existing profiles with the same email before insertion
  - Use a more robust approach to handle email uniqueness
  - Generate unique emails for users with conflicting email addresses
  - Add comprehensive error logging with detailed information
  - Make profile creation more resilient with multiple fallback strategies

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling in Auth Callback

- Updated the `app/auth/callback/route.ts` to better detect and handle database errors
- Added specific error messages for database setup issues
- Improved error detection for uniqueness constraint violations
- Enhanced error redirection with more context for troubleshooting

### 3. Updated Auth Error Page

- Improved the `app/auth/auth-error/page.tsx` file to:
  - Show more specific error messages based on error type
  - Provide clearer guidance to users encountering database errors
  - Include a "Contact Support" button with detailed error information
  - Simplify the error page UI for better user experience

### 4. SQL Fixes for Database

Created SQL migration scripts to address database issues:

#### RLS Policy Fixes (`migrations/fix_profiles_rls.sql`)
```sql
-- Create policy to allow service role to insert any profile
CREATE POLICY "Service role can insert any profile"
ON profiles FOR INSERT
TO service_role
USING (true);

-- Create policy to allow service role to update any profile
CREATE POLICY "Service role can update any profile"
ON profiles FOR UPDATE
TO service_role
USING (true);

-- Make email nullable to work around unique constraint issues
ALTER TABLE profiles ALTER COLUMN email DROP NOT NULL;
```

#### Diagnostic and Fix Functions (`migrations/db_diagnostic_functions.sql`)
Created functions to:
- Create the profiles table if missing
- Add required RLS policies
- Find users without profiles
- Detect and fix duplicate emails
- Diagnose database setup issues

### 5. Admin Diagnostic API

Added an endpoint at `app/api/system/fix-database/route.ts` that:
- Runs diagnostic checks on the database setup
- Attempts to fix common issues automatically
- Provides detailed reports of database status
- Creates missing profiles for existing users
- Resolves email uniqueness conflicts

## How To Apply These Fixes

1. Run the SQL migration scripts in your Supabase database:
   ```bash
   psql -h your_supabase_host -U postgres -d postgres -f migrations/fix_profiles_rls.sql
   psql -h your_supabase_host -U postgres -d postgres -f migrations/db_diagnostic_functions.sql
   ```

2. Deploy the updated code to your application.

3. Access the diagnostic API at `/api/system/fix-database` (in development mode) to check for and fix any remaining issues.

## Prevention of Future Issues

1. Added automatic handling of email uniqueness conflicts
2. Implemented more robust error detection and handling
3. Enhanced logging for easier troubleshooting
4. Created diagnostic tools to quickly identify and resolve database issues
